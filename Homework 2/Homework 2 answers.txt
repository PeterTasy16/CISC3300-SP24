1. Structual elements are strictly that, structural: they deal only in how the page is laid out. 
Semantic elements provide superficial information, such as a quotation, or a paragraph, or a header.

2. Using correct HTML elements helps in informing the browser about its contents, which make the site easier to access.
Using correct elements also helps to make the site easier to navigate on the user end.

3. Forms allow the users of a site to input data on a site, and allow that data to be stored on a web server.
You'd use them whenever a site needs user input, such as inputting user information in a document, or a submit button, or a checkbox.

4. Inline elements, as the name suggests, are elements that do not start on a new line, and only take up as much width as necessary,
like an <img> element. Conversely, block elements must start on a new line, taking up the full width of their container,
like a <div> element.
