Homework 4 Question Answers

1. JavaScript is an interpreted programming language that is widely used for web development.
Interpreted languages are executed line by line, while compiled languages are translated
entirely into machine code before executing.

2. var is function-scoped, let is block-scoped, and const is also block-scoped but with a value 
that cannot be reassigned after declaration. 

3. Anonymous functions are functions without a name, often defined inline without a declaration. 
Higher-order functions are functions that can accept other functions as arguments or return functions as results.

4. 
In JavaScript, objects are collections of key-value pairs where values can be of any data type, including functions and other objects.
OOP languages use objects as instances of classes and heavily rely on encapsulation and inheritance. They are
a lot less flexible.
