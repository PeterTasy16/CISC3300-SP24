1. First, after the user enters the URL, they are connected by their ISP to the relevant DNS.
The DNS then sends out the specific IP address of the site your computed requested, which then allows your 
device to access the web server hosting the site.
- ISP stands for internet service provider, companies that provide services to access the internet
- a DNS is a domain name server, which effectively maps domains to IP address, like a person to a phone number in a phone book
- URL is the unique identifier that tells the DNS what site the user wants
- A web server is the actual host of the site in question


2. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is effectively the coding language that defines the structure
of a particular web page, through the use of tags and elements.


3. Looking at Fordham's site, it's easy to pick it apart. Important tabs that users might need are situated clearly
at the top of the page, while opposite to them is the logo of the university, clearly stating who runs the page.
A search bar is provided for anybody that does not find what they need in the tabs, and highlights of the university
are posted front and center on the page.


4. A tag is a keyword enclosed in angle brackets that define the structure of an HTML page, like <p> </p>.
An element is an opening and closing tag, along with its content, like <p> This is a paragraph </P>
An attribute is a special keyword in the opening tag that changes an element's behavior, like "href" to link a site
to an element.
