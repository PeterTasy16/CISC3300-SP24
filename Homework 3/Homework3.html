        <h1>Computer Science</h1>
        <p>Degree Options: Major, Minor ,<br>
            Locations: Lincoln Center, Rose Hill<br>
            Visit the Computer and Information Science Department</p>
        <p>Wherever there’s a computer, there’s a skilled person developing, maintaining, hacking, advancing or simply using it. Be that person.</p>
        <p>It’s difficult to imagine life without computers when they’re so central<br>
            to our information-driven global society. But it’s not difficult to imagine<br>
            the amazing pursuits you’ll be prepared for with a degree in computer<br>
            science from Fordham’s department of Computer and Information<br>
            Sciences.</p>

        <p>The computer science major emphasizes science and technology,<br>
            including software design and programming, computer architecture<br>
            and functions, and the development of an ability to analyze and solve<br>
            problems in using the computer as a tool.</p>
            
        <p>Get inspired by the classes we offer. Programming. Bioinformatics. Robotics. Video game design. Cyber security.<br>
            Networking. Database management. Health and medical informatics.</p>

        <p>Our faculty members are active researchers driven by intellectual curiosity and the desire to make an<br>
            impact. Join them in one of our labs. Requirements: open mind, warm heart, and lots of passion.</p>

        <p>You’ll learn more than computer science here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, mathematics,<br>
            languages, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal<br>
            arts education. We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.</p>
